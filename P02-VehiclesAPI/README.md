## My Udacity Submission

Hello, this is my submission for the Bakcned System for a Car Website.

## Running the app

I've developed the app using IntelliJ mostly. All the apps can be run from my local machine. I would start with eureka, then pricingService, mapsService and, finally, vehicleService.

## Configuration

I've left most of the project configuration intact.For example, the link to swagger-ui is: [Swagger-UI for Cars API](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html#/).

There is one thing I've to notice, while testing the Swagger-ui, it is locked at first time the endpoints which are of the form `/cars/{id}`. You may have to click "Try out" for it to let you change the id. 

I have price ids for the first 20 cars. Further ids wont be available.
